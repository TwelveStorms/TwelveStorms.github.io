    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <div>
      <p>This design is very personal to me. The Impala build is based off of my first car: The 2003 Chevy Impala.</p>
      <img src="img/impala.jpg" alt="Impala" style="width:440px;height:328px;">
      <p>Even though this piece of junk gave me more problems than solutions, it taught me how to drive. This car has been in my family since I was only in middle school. It was then passed down to me when I was old enough to drive when I was 18 years old.</p>
